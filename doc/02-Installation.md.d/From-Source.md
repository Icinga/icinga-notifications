# Installing Icinga Notifications from Source

Although the provided packages are highly recommended and are the only officially supported installation,
it may be necessary to build the software manually, e.g., if there are no packages available for the target platform.

Please follow the build instructions in the [development section](30-Development.md)
for more information about requirements and the `Makefile`-based build.
